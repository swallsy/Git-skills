<h1>Sara</h1>
<p>I'm originally from Greenville, NC. But have spent most of my life in Raleigh and Durham. Before coding I worked at a digital marketing/content agency as a hybrid project/account manager. We worked with clients like IBM and GE to make marketing assets like live action videos, animations, and sometimes if we were lucky, interactive items. I worked on a large 2 year project that was dealing with the redesign of a large engineering solutions site. I loved being so involved with the interactive components of that projects and decided I wanted to be on the end of creating instead of in the role of project managing.</p>
